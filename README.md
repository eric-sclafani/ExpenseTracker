# Expense Tracker

This expense tracker is built with Angular on the frontend, ASP.NET for the backend, and SQLite for data needs.

It is based off my Expenses spreadsheet.

## Requirements

-   Can set a budget (cash in, cash out, disp income)

-   Can set mandatory monthly expenses (rent, loans, etc...)

-   Can add new expenses (using same columns as spreadsheet )

-   Maybe display expenses inside of editable table?

-   The available amount will not be stored and is calulcated each time
